          Change Is Hard… But You're Not Broken
        </h2>
        <p>
          Change is hard. Making a change for ourselves is often even harder. Our habits and routines
          can help or hinder us from doing the things that are important to us in life. We can
          misinterpret the struggle to change as a personal failure resulting from a lack of
          discipline or willpower.

          Spoiler: Willpower Isn’t the Hero Here
        </h2>
        <p>
          Science tells us that discipline and willpower are not what drive real change. Real and
          sustained change begins with learning how to understand why you do what you do, how that
          aligns with who you are, and then setting up your environment to make the change happen
          naturally.

          The D6 Approach (AKA: “Let’s Make This Make Sense”)
        </h2>
        <p>
          At The Habit AEffect, we walk you through a single habit change and teach you the skills
          and tools that will allow you to continue to make the changes that you want. We help you
          see the current patterns of your behavior and figure out what role they are filling in your
          life. We help you determine which tools will allow you to make a change that fits your
          lifestyle. And then we help you build a plan where gaining or breaking a habit is the
          easiest thing to do.
        </p>
        <p>
          We condense over 100 years of behavioral science into the D6 Approach. This straightforward,
          six-stage action plan is flexible enough to work for everyone, yet grounded in scientifically
          proven tools that are effective.

          Why I Built Habit AEffect
        </h2>
        <p>
          Before founding The Habit AEffect, I spent 10 years teaching these concepts and skills to
          college students. I've helped over a hundred students change their habits. But these are
          skills that everyone needs, and I want to teach them to you.

          A Judgment-Free Zone (Seriously.)
        </h2>
        <p>
          At Habit AEffect, we want to teach you to be in control of your habits, instead of having
          your habits control you. We are a judgment-free space and we’re here to help you begin your
          habit change journey in a way that fits who you are and what you need.
        </p>
        <p>
          We’re not here to tell you what you “should” be doing. This is your journey — we’re just
          giving you the tools to make the ride smoother.
