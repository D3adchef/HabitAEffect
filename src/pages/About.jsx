          Habit Æffect was built on the belief that real, lasting change happens
          through understanding our behaviors and taking small, meaningful steps
          toward transformation. The D6 Method helps individuals break unhelpful
          patterns, build healthy habits, and create sustainable progress with
          clarity, confidence, and compassion.
        </p>

        <p>
          This program blends behavioral science, structured guidance, and
          personalized support to help clients identify how their habits formed,
          why certain behaviors repeat, and how to build new patterns that
          actually stick.
        </p>

        <p>
          Habit Æffect is more than a coaching service — it’s a partnership in
          growth. This approach empowers individuals to connect their goals with
          their strengths and values, making change feel possible, accessible,
          and even exciting.
