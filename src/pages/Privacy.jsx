        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>
          Habit AEffect may collect personal information that you voluntarily
          provide, such as your name, email address, and session-related details.
          Additional optional data may be collected through scheduling platforms,

        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">How Your Information Is Used</h2>
        <p>
          Your information is used to deliver coaching services, communicate

        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">Data Security</h2>
        <p>
          Habit AEffect takes reasonable steps to protect your information from
          unauthorized access or disclosure. Third-party platforms such as
          Calendly, Google Forms, and Stripe maintain their own security policies
          and procedures.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>
          Some features of this website rely on third-party tools. Information
          shared through those systems is handled according to their respective
          privacy policies, and users are encouraged to review them as needed.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">Your Rights</h2>
        <p>
          You may request access to, correction of, or deletion of your personal
          data. More detailed instructions will be included in the final version of
          this policy.
        </p>

          This placeholder version will be replaced with a full privacy policy
          drafted for the official Habit AEffect platform.
