          Habit Æffect is committed to creating a digital experience that is
          accessible, inclusive, and user-friendly for all individuals. This

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">Our Commitment</h2>
        <p>
          We strive to ensure that our website and materials are usable for visitors
          with diverse abilities, needs, and preferences. This includes attention to
          readability, contrast, navigation, screen-reader compatibility, and
          neurodivergent-friendly design principles.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">Ongoing Improvements</h2>
        <p>
          Accessibility is an ongoing effort. As Habit Æffect grows, we will
          continue improving features such as keyboard navigation, alternative text
          for images, structured headings, descriptive links, and compatibility with
          assistive technologies.
        </p>
